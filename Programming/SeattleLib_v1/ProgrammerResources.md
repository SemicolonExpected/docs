### Description

This section contains all the extraneous data structures that Seattle supports, in addition to all the various backend modules that makes seash work. There are several utilities which can help with basic programming tasks such as [math.repy](math.repy.md), [random.repy](random.repy.md), and etc. Notably modules include:

[safe_eval.repy](safe_eval.repy.md) allows one to safely evaluate strings, free from the context of whatever it is in.

[argparse.repy](argparse.repy.md) checks command line arguments and separates in a way that is usable. This utility can be used within the context of whatever program it's in, making this a very useful module.

[urlparse.repy](urlparse.repy.md) parses urls for network communication purposes. This is primarily used in the XML parsing section.

Please note that the The backend modules that are located here are mostly ones that the average user would not have to consider.
