### Description

This class of modules supported by the Seattle Standard Library deal with URLs and XML. In most cases, Seattle utilizes the XML-RPC protocol to communicate between computers. The remote procedure calls (RPC) are achieved by using HTTP requests. In XML-RPC, the parameter for the the HTTP requests can be nested, in this case with XML. 

In any case that the XML-RPC service is desirable, [xmlrpc_server.repy](xmlrpc_server.repy.md) should be used. There rest of the modules described here which are mostly helper modules to [xmlrpc_server.repy](xmlrpc_server.repy.md).

Note also there are many parallels between these modules and equivalent Python modules. Please email [shurui@cs.washington.edu] if I have failed to link any.
